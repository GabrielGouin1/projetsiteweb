00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What's that for? What does that mean, why is it like that, where is it?
Who is he?


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One question: how many planets are there in the solar system?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Between 1930, the year Pluto was discovered by American Clyde Tombaugh, and 2006,
there were nine planets

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
namely, from closest to the Sun to furthest away: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and Pluto but in 2006 another American, Mike
Brown

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
nicknamed “Pluto Killer,” demonstrated that Pluto is not a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
planet like the others. Why? Because it is too small and not unique enough

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000,
 similar to many objects present in the Neptune region such as

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Eris, discovered by him in 2006. Pluto then became a dwarf planet,
and this discovery brought the number of true planets down to eight, at least 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
until January 20, 2016, when Mike Brown, again, and Konstantin 
Batygin

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
working together, claimed to have discovered a ninth planet through calculation.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:32.000
According to the two astronomers, only the presence of a planet 10 times heavier

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
than Earth can explain
